            <div class="info-main">
               <h2 class="three">We are more than 350 people from 30 different countries<br> divided between our headquarters in Berlin and our offices in<br> Los Angeles and Tokyo.</h2>
                <p class="data-info">Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us use Live and Push every day.<br> We come from a wide range of cultural and professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs,<br> some are self-taught, and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared<br> belief that each of us has the skills and knowledge to contribute to something big: helping to<br> shape the future of music culture.</p>

                <p class="data-info">Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try to give our people what they need to work<br>their magic and grow. We’ve learned that achieving the best results comes from building teams<br> that are richly diverse, and thus able to explore problems from a wider set of perspectives. We <br> don’t always agree with each other, but opinion and debate are valued and openly encouraged.</p>

                Alongside an internal training program, employees are actively supported in acquiring new<br> knowledge and skills, and coached on applying these in their daily work. In addition, staff-<br>organized development and music salons are a chance to discuss new technologies, production<br> techniques and best practices.</p>
